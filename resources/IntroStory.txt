According to the legend, there once was a kingdom named Oak.
Oak had three magic stones that kept the kingdom prosperous and protected from evil spirits.
The Protection Stone defended the kingdom and its citizens from the evil forces.
The Life Stone gave life and allowed crops and nature to flourish.
The Wisdom Stone enhanced intuition, awareness,and passed extensive knowledge of ancestors to the holder.
The stones were too powerful for any single being to possess, therefore they were always kept separate.
King Luis I (the first) assigned these stones to his General, Priest, and most prestigious Guard Knight.
All holders vowed under oath to have their lineage protect the stones foreverâ€¦

Two hundred years later King Alex ascends to the throne...
One day King Alex called the General to report to him,
but the General never showed and was reported missing along with the Protection Stone.
With the Protection Stone missing the kingdom was now vulnerable to contact with the evil spirits.

A demonic creature known in legend as The Ghoul appeared on a very dark night
and began to ravage the kingdom and kill its citizens. It is said that the Ghoul has envy and hatred
for the living as it never got the opportunity to have a life of its own. The Ghoul cut the kingdom's population
by 1/4 in a span of repeated attacks and managed to steal the Life Stone.

With the Protection Stone and Life Stone missing
the kingdom rapidly began collapsing due to a decrease in the population and famine.

You, as the bravest knight in the Guard Guild, have been entrusted with the Wisdom Stone.
King Alex has a special mission for you to kill the Ghoul at the "Lost Castle" and find the Life Stone.

Your King and his citizens depend on you to restore balance to the kingdom.
