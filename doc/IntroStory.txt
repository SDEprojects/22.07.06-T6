According to legend, there was a kingdom named Oak.
Oak has three magic stones kept the kingdom prosperous and protected from monsters.
The Protection Stone defended the people from evil spirits and demons.
The Life Stone gave life to crops and nature. The Wisdom Stone enhanced intuition, awareness,
and passed extensive knowledge of ancestors to the holder. Since the stones were too powerful,
King Luis I (the first) assigned these stones to his General, Priest, and Guard Knights.
All holders vowed under oath to have their lineage protect the stones foreverâ€¦
